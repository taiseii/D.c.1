Detecting Diabetic retinopathy using DCNN. TU/e course
<h1> Detecting Diabetic Retinopathy </h1>
Used Deep convolutional neural network for image recognition to determine stages of diabetic retinopathy.
Model was trained in the google cloud and data was loaded from the bucket.
VGG16 like atchitecture is used.
